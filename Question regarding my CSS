If you go to "resources\css\style.css" you can see the identifier(line 386)  

    footer .content{
        font-size: .625rem;
      } 
  
under

    @media only screen and (max-width: 760px){
    }


should supposedly change the font-size of the footer to .625rem from .75rem when the width of the window is under 760px but apparently it is not working. I checked under the dev tools it is still fetching the .75 identifier.
Any clues where i might be going wrong?
